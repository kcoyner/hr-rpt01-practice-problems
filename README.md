# Practice Problems

We want you to be as successful as possible in the program.  One way to optimize your opportunities for success is to continuously practice your fundamentals.

This repo is available for you to practice problems from sources outside of Hack Reactor -- both those your mentor finds and those you find -- so that you can track your progress and share it with your Cohort Support Team.

Use of this repo is optional unless it is prescribed to you by your Technical Mentor or another member of your support team.  In that instance, they will provide you with guidance about how they would like you to use it.

## Mentor Contributions

From time-to-time your Technical Mentor or HiR will add problems to this repo for you to challenge yourself with.  Pull from this repo often to make sure you have the latest catalog of problems.

## Your contributions

You are encouraged to find interesting problems in books, on the Internet, from friends and other repos in GitHub and add them to your fork of this repo.  We invite you to submit pull requests to the "student submissions" branch of this repo of any problems you found especially useful or challenging for inclusion into the catalog for other students.  We may modify those problems slightly to better support our instructional objectives before adding them to the problem list.

## Program Completion

Because the problems in this repo are sourced from various public sites and are not Hack Reactor intellectual property, unlike the Hack Reactor Toy Problem repo that you are given, you are free to liberate this repo at the completion of the program.
